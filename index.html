          <p>
              We bring modern design and manufacturing practice to Cambodia in order to make custom and mass-market product development possible for local companies and organisations.
          </p>
          <p>We have the expertise and tools to make your next design project happen here in Cambodia, including electrical/electronic and mechanical prototyping, design for manufacture, and support from ideation to production.</p>
          <p>With a healthy blend of technical competence and artistic vision, we can apply creative thinking matched by a great weight of experience to an idea. A developed appreciation of the design process means that we approach every product idea with a refined brief and goals, delivering products on time and keeping the client constantly briefed. As a group of consultants we have worked on a large array of products for NGOs, private companies and agencies, including United Nations  Development Projects (UNDP), Development Innovations (DI) and Phnom Penh Special Economic Zone (PPSEZ).
          </p>
          <p>We encourage enquiries from prospective customers who may worry their ideas are too difficult to realise locally, and from those trying to understand the range of possible solutions for an early-stage project, as well as those with fully-scoped and clear project goals.</p>

            <b>
              An expert is someone who knows some of the worst mistakes that can be made in his subject, and how to avoid them.
            </b>
          </h3>
          <b><p>As a team, our expertise stretches from the earliest stages of ideation and scoping to the final throes of production and verification, on a range of software, hardware, electronics, simulation, display, demonstration, architectural and integrated projects.</p></b>
          <p>For projects requiring in-depth technical development we can turn to our in-house experts. As a project comes together, our team works as a cohesive whole to ensure it all runs smoothly, and gets out of the door on time and on budget.</p>
          <p>In many cases, we are able to provide design and fabrication services that are not otherwise available in the country. We also prioritise clear, direct communication with our customers at all stages in the development cycle, so that you have more involvement (if that’s what you want), and more certainty over delivery timetables.</p>

          <h4 class="service-heading">CAD (Computer Aided Design)</h4>
          <p class="text-muted">Computer Aided Design (CAD) gets ideas off paper and into the digital world. Many people can collaborate on a single design, iterating faster and always staying up to date. Integrated technologies such as mechanical simulation and photorealistic rendering ensure that the design performs as envisioned, both functionally and aesthetically.</p>

          <p class="text-muted">It’s no good designing to sub-mm precision if you can’t manufacture it reliably. Computer Aided Manufacturing (CAM) allows computerised tools to control manufacturing processes, ensuring precision, speed and quality. Designing with manufacturing in mind smooths the process from prototype to product.</p>

          <p class="text-muted">You can’t solve every problem on a sheet of paper! Large datasets, complex or overlapping processes, and multiple variables can be encoded in a computer simulation. This approach to problem-solving allows you to ask and answer far-reaching questions about performance, behaviour and expected outcomes that would otherwise be intractable, from business to biology.</p>

          <p class="text-muted">Wherever it makes sense we fabricate or manufacture with local suppliers or in-house, maintaining a focus on quality and reliability. Projects are realised faster (since we can iterate designs faster), on tighter budgets, and with more accountability. Hands-on customers get more involvement in the process too.</p>

          <h4 class="service-heading">Architectural Modelling</h4>
          <p class="text-muted">A fantastic model speaks for itself. Convey quality, purpose and context for clients, and articulate the messages you wish to send. Beyond the shape of the building itself, the choice of materials, environment, interactivity and availability of relevant information in an architectural model is an important consideration. Making models locally means better communication, faster turnaround, and fewer surprises.</p>

                <p class="item-intro text-muted">How can we warn thousands of people downstream of an imminent flood in rural Cambodia?</p>
                <img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="img/projects/distributed-1.jpg" alt="">
                <p>Tepmachcha (Mermaid) started as a project internal to Development Innovations. People in Need Cambodia came to Bespokh when they took the project on, looking to build more and better sensors, reduce manufacturing costs, and add some functionality to make the project truly scalable.</p>
                <p>Starting with a review of the existing sensor platform, we identified key components of the software and hardware design that were targets for improvement, both in terms of saving money, and improving functionality. Making and managing a large fleet of identical sensors in very inaccessible locations demanded improved reliability, reduced costs, ease of integration with national disaster management systems, and the ability to update sensor control software over the air.</p>
                <p>Bespokh was able to create custom hardware that allows for the use of different off-the-shelf components in any configuration, removing supply bottlenecks for certain components, and reducing costs per unit. Sensor enclosures were improved to IP67 standard, and a brand new software stack allows for updating units over their built in cellular network connection, removing the need for expensive site visits.</p>
                <p>The new sensor systems are now active across Cambodia.</p>

                <p class="item-intro text-muted">How can we distil the contributions of dozens of project stakeholders into a simple, beautiful, and understandable form?</p>
                <img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="img/projects/waste-managment-1.jpg" alt="">
                <p>Design Kompany and UNDP tasked Bespokh with prototyping contributed ideas for solutions to a serious waste management problem in Siem Reap wet markets. After 3 days of human-centred design workshops, the team had to convert diverse ideas to physical reality under a tight deadline.</p>
                <p>Understanding the need for clear context as well as useful detail, we identified two key deliverables that would convey the location, nature and severity of the problem, along with the in-depth explanation that these ideas deserved. The deliverables needed to be easily transportable, quick to grab attention, and readily understandable.</p>
                <p>Bespokh created a small format architectural model of the problem space, incorporating not only the visible physical elements, but logistical, utility and human factors too - all in an intuitive and visually striking manner. Viewers can understand the interplay between different constraints and considerations, and see the proposed solutions in context. Additionally, we created a detailed mechanical study and model of one particular solution at larger scale, verifying the basic premise of the design, and allowing users to get hands-on with ideas only previously available on paper.</p>
                <p>The models are now being used to help stakeholders and policy-makers gain common understanding, and shape decisions.</p>

                <p>Mirobot is a popular software platform allowing wireless WiFi robots to roam in classrooms, responding to sensor and user inputs, and running programs written in variety of education-friendly languages. STEM Phnom Penh wanted to make use of the open source software and create robotic hardware that was durable and straightforward to manufacture locally.</p>
                <p>Beginning with the open-source schematics for the international project, the team optimised component choices, redesigned and shrunk the electronic PCBs, and designed new hardware from the ground up. The new version would be smaller, faster, tougher, and better looking, whilst costing less to manufacture.</p>
                <p>With 90% of the components coming off any consumer desktop 3d printer without further finishing work, new PCBs fitting into the cheapest <25cm² production range, a range of modular choices for electronic components with greater local supply chain reliability, and also looking pretty cool, the new robots are an improvement that fits well in a local context. Plus all the new design work is still open-source, allowing users to understand their technology on multiple levels.</p>
                <p>The robots are now beeping, trundling and sensing in Cambodian workshops.</p>

                <img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="img/projects/operation-1.jpg" alt="">
                <p>RSL came to Bespokh when they wanted to make their proprietary simulation model available and easy to use by laypersons, policy makers and local government. Including a myriad of factors and considerations, this extensive waste management simulation and costing model was complex to use, and only ran on a local computer.</p>
                <p>Recognizing that the simulation model was a product in constant development and refinement, the solution needed to allow the waste management experts to continue to adapt their model, without requiring rework. The model must be accessible to selected users over the internet, provide both an intuitive interface, and meaningful reporting.</p>
                <p>Bespokh used highly reliable web services and took the simulation model online, creating a simple, bilingual web app interface page for users and a standard, accessible and familiar reporting format. Controlling access to different parts of the simulation and web app allows experts at RSL to manage and update their models with peace of mind, whilst users see only the parts relevant to them, with the ability to save and manipulate their reports in spreadsheet format. User interactions can be tracked to assess impact and usage, and model updates are instant.</p>
                <p>The solid waste management simulation is available online now for users that have requested and been granted access.</p>

                <img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="img/projects/interactive-installation-1.jpg" alt="">
                <p>In May 2016 Phnom Penh Special Economic Zone (PPSEZ) became one of the first Cambodian companies to list on the Cambodian Stock Exchange (CSX). To celebrate this occasion PPSEZ commissioned a show-piece architectural and landscape model that presented a scale view of the entire estate to be revealed at the IPO at Raffles Hotel le Royal. No small feat considering the fact there are over four hundred factories on the 7.5 km -long site!</p>
                <p>The great challenge of this project was to bring together scale, relationship and function for the many and varied buildings in a visually harmonious way. Sections and buildings were to be illuminated by status to assist PPSEZ staff in sales to investors. Additionally the model must be straightforward to move and maintain.</p>
                <p>After surveying the site with drone photography and satellite mapping a 3D computer model of the entire site was created, from which our experts were able to craft custom electronics, bespoke 3D-printed buildings and features, back-lit acrylic landscapes and clear logistical demarcation for access roads. The whole model came together as six enormous table sections covering 6 metres, delivered on time, on budget, and looking fantastic.</p>
                <p>The installation was a source of great interest at the CSX event, with viewers immediately informed about the detail and context of their investments.</p>
